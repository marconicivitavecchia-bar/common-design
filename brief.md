Order-management service for coffee bar inside a public or private school. This service aims to make ordering activities faster, reduce the number of errors and increase flexibility. This service is intended for the students of the schools and the bar manager. To make an order, students use their personal smartphone, while the bar manager can use a tablet or a desktop computer. Local school network is used, if available, or an internet connection otherwise. The pair student-class is made automatically by interfacing with services like Moodle, or manually by the class representative.

**Background**: today schools try to reduce the mess during playtime in several ways, as making paper lists bring from a student directly to the bar manager. This solution has several problems, eg. force one or more students to lose part of a lesson. Moreover, once delivered, the paper list cannot be modified. This service aims mainly to resolve these issues.
